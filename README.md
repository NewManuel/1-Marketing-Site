# Marketing Website



## Purpose 

```
Ensuring web accessibility is becoming increasingly vital for businesses. It guarantees that individuals with disabilities can navigate websites using various assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.With this website the objective is to render the site accessible to individuals who may need such support. Apart from fostering inclusivity, accessibility is advantageous for businesses in several ways. Firstly, it enhances search engine rankings, particularly on platforms like Google. Additionally, it aids companies in averting potential legal issues that may arise from the inability of people with disabilities to access a website.
